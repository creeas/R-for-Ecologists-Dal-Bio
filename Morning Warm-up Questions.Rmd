#Morning warm-ups
The following sections are just some warm-up questions for us to do together each morning to get our brains working and refresh what we covered the previous day.


```{r}
# Load cetacean.csv


#Subset data to only include those entries from Scotland


#How many entries are in the database?


#How many unique species are in the Scotland database?



#What is the range of the ages in the Scotland database?



#Subset the original data to only include those entries from Scotland that are also from the Phocoenaphocoena and greater than 8 years of age. 



#Subset the database to only include those entries that are not from Scotland



#Plot the age distribution of cetacean from Scotland and Spain in boxplots by species and location. 



#Plot the age distribution of cetaceans by Dolphin.ID from Scotland and from Spain. Use a dot plot, make the Spain points orange and the Scotland points blue. 


```



## libraries
```{r libraries, include=FALSE}
#how do I load the `tidyverse` package

```

## Data loading

```{r brain size data}
#how do I load my `abalone.csv` file and create a new dataframe?

```

## Including Plots

```{r plotting}
#how do I plot the entire dataset for an exploratory check?

#how do I plot Whole Weight over age?

#how do I change this plot to distinguish between males and females?

#how can I create separate plots for males and females using facets in ggplot?
```
